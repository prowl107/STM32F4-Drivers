# STM32F4-Drivers
> A collection of low level drivers for STM32F4 sseries microcontrollers. 

## About
The goal of this project was to write a collection of low level drivers to understand more about developing embedded software. The project is developed using embedded C. Having to write the drivers myself required that I took the time to learn and understand the peripheral/protocol throughly. The process so far has been challenging but rewarding.
